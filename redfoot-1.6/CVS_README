
The medusa sdist is expected to be a subdirectory of this one. At the moment, the version from project oedipus' CVS is required since it contains a needed bug fix to medusa-0.5.2. See:
  http://oedipus.sourceforge.net/



Building Release from CVS

  - update CHANGELOG 
  - tag the release 
    - cvs tag RELEASE_XX_XX_XX 
  - up CVS major revision (so 2.0 = first release, 3.0 = second release, etc) 
    - cvs commit -m "NEW RELEASE" -r y.0 
    - cvs update -A 
  - export to a new directory 
  cvs -d eikeon@eikco.com:/home/cvsroot/eikco export -r HEAD -d redfoot-1.5.1 redfoot


  - remove some file:
    CVS_README, .cvsignore(s) and lib/setup.py lib/setup-components.py

  - extract medusa into redfoot-X.X.X/medusa/

  - tar, zip
    - tar -cvz -f redfoot-1.5.1.tgz redfoot-1.5.1 

  - release on sourceforge (or whereever hosted) 
  - send freshmeat announcement 
  - announce elsewhere (relevant mailing lists, news groups, etc)
