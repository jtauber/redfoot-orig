Version 0.5.2-rf1:

* Fixed composite producer; was causing http_server not to work when
  chunking

Version 0.5.2:

* Fix syntax error and missing import in default_handler.py
* Fix various scripts in demo/

Version 0.5.1:

* Apply cleanup patch from Donovan Baarda
* Fix bug reported by Van Gale: counter.py and auth_handler.py did
  long(...)[:-1] to chop off a trailing L generated in earlier
  versions of Python.
* Fix bug in ftp_server.py that I introduced in 0.5
* Remove some duplicated producer classes
* Removed work_in_progress/ directory and the 'continuation' module

Version 0.5:

* Added a setup.py installation script, which will install all the code
  under the package name 'medusa'.
* Added README.txt and CHANGES.txt.
* Fixed NameError in util/convert_mime_type_table.py 
* Fixed TypeError in test/test_medusa.py
* Fixed several problems detected by PyChecker
* Changed demos to use 'from medusa import ...'
* Rearranged files to reduce the number of subdirectories.
* Removed or updated uses of the obsolete regsub module
* Removed asyncore.py and asynchat.py; these modules were added to Python's
  standard library with version 1.5.2, and Medusa now assumes that they're 
  present.
* Removed many obsolete files:
     poll/pollmodule.c, as Python's select module now supports poll()
     patches/posixmodule.c, as that patch was incorporated in Python
     old/*, script_handler_demo/*, sendfile/*
     The old ANNOUNCE files
* Reindented all files to use four-space indents


The last version of Medusa released by Sam Rushing was medusa-20010416.
