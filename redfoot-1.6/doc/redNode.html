    <h1>Red Node</h1>

    <p> At the core of a Redfoot application is the concept of a
rednode. A rednode is a triple store that is able to participate in a
peer to peer network of rednodes. <span class="ednote">NOTE: much more p2p functionality is in the works and should start appearing in 1.5.x</span>
    </p>
    <p> Redfoot's default RedNode currently is a triple store that is
queryable via high level queries, can manage a set of neighbouring
triple stores, [automatically] save to RDF/XML syntax, and load from
RDF/XML syntax. Rednodes are implemented as the class
<CODE>RedNode</CODE> in lib/redfootlib/rednode.py
    </p>

    <P>A rednode has a local triple store (which is read/write) and any number of neighbour triple stores
       (which are read only). The combination of the local store and neighbour stores is referred to as the
       neighbourhood. The process of adding a new neighbour is referred to as connecting to that neighbour.</P>

    <P>When a rednode is created, the RDF syntax and schema files are added to the neighbourhood automatically
       as well as a schema for some builtin classes and properties used by Redfoot.</P>

    <H4>Code Example</H4>
    
    <PRE CLASS="code_sample">
rednode = RedNode()
rednode.load(<VAR>location</VAR>, <VAR>URI_if_different</VAR>)
rednode.connect_to(<VAR>location</VAR>)

# query the local store
rednode.visit(<VAR>callback</VAR>, (<VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR>, <VAR>object</VAR>))

# query only the neighbours
rednode.neighbours.visit(<VAR>callback</VAR>, (<VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR>, <VAR>object</VAR>))

# query the whole neighbourhood (local + neighbours)
rednode.neighbourhood.visit(<VAR>callback</VAR>, (<VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR>, <VAR>object</VAR>))
