indexFiles.py

This Python script will run around your archive of Chump XML files, creating
index.xml files.  At the root of your tree of XML files it will create a
nav.xml file.

These files can be used to build up links into an archive. For an example of
how they might be used, look at the xslt directory of this distribution.

Usage:

  indexFiles.py /path/to/xml/root

(you can also set the 'dir' variable in the source. Ensure the directory 
you give it is the immediate parent of the year directories).
