mod_xslt.patch

This patch against the Apache web server module mod_xslt version 1.1
<http://modxslt.userworld.com/> enables more sophisticated configuration for
the location of stylesheets than the original.  This allows you to set up
stylesheets in a separate directory to where the XML files are actually stored.

To use, follow the instructions from the web site above.  The extra
configuration this patch allows is:

  XSLTSheetDir /path/to/xslt_files

This makes mod_xslt look for stylesheets in the directory:

  /path/to/xslt_files/server.domain/

Where server.domain is the name of your server as configured by the ServerName
directive.  This allows the use of mod_xslt with virtual named servers.
