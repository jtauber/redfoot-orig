Daily Chump Bot Installation

  $Id$

The Daily Chump Bot requires Python version 1.5.2 or greater. Copy all
the .py files in the src directory to a directory of your choosing and
run it from that directory with the command:

  python dailychumpbot.py

The bot takes the following commandline arguments:

  -s    server (address of the IRC server to connect to)
  -p    port (port on the IRC server, defaults to 6667 if not specified)
  -n    nick (IRC nickname to use)
  -c    channel (channel to join - specify the name with the # included)
  -d    directory (where to store the XML. This directory should already
        exist. The bot will create subdirectories named by year, month
        and date to store its archives in)
  -e    URL of a stylesheet (can be relative).  Either a CSS or XSLT 
        stylesheet that a processor can use to style the XML.
