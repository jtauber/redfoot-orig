	RELEASE 1.5.1

	Introduced redfoot.py, a console interface for running Redfoot.

	Added more documentation!

	Renamed top level package name of core library from redfoot to
	redfootlib.

	Refactored RedNode and the classes which compose it, adding (more)
	source level documentation along the way. [NOTE: RedNode no longer
	has a local store but now is the local and contains its
	neighbourhood and neighbours as attributes. Also, RedNode's visit
	no longer visits the entire neighbourhood and so rednode.visit
	will now need to be rednode.neighbourhood.visit.]

	Resource and Literal no longer have .url and .value, as all the
	old references that did not take advantage of Resource and Literal
	being subclasses of string have been removed.

	Resource and Literal are no longer being interned. Saving memory
	and allowing them to be garbage collected.
	
	Cleaned up mixin classes to be more cooperative (fixing a number
	of bugs that would crop up with the classes where mixed in certain
	ways).

	Neighbour management code is now mixed into RedNode instead of
	being hard coded into it.

	redfoot.xml.handler.HandlerBase is now subclassed to take care of
	the different needs of RDF and Redcode parsing

	Changed directory structure to make division between core,
	components, doc and examples more pronounced.

	Added setup.py scripts to the various.

	Cleaned up interface for getting a Rednode up and runing, as well
	as command line options.

	Removed auto reloading of python and redcode modules.
