REDFOOT README

    Redfoot is a framework for distributed RDF-based applications,
    written in Python by James Tauber and Daniel Krech.

    At present, Redfoot includes:

       - an RDF database
       - a query API for RDF with numerous higher-level query
         functions 
       - an RDF parser and serializer
       - a simple HTTP server providing a web interface for viewing
         and editing RDF
       - a fully customizable UI
       - the beginnings of a peer-to-peer architecture for
         communication between different RDF databases

    In the future, Redfoot will hopefully include:

        - a full peer-to-peer architecture for discovery of RDF
          statements
        - an inference engine
        - connectors for mapping non-RDF data into RDF triples
        - sample applications built on top of Redfoot

    Redfoot is written in pure Python (Python 2.0 required) and is 
    being tested on both windows and linux (requires PyExpat).

    Redfoot currently uses eikeon's Bare Naked HTTP server which is
    included in the standard distribution.

RUNNING THE REDFOOT SERVER

    1. Make sure the ./lib/ directory of redfoot is on the python
       path.

    2. Run

           python server.py <options>

           -l location of RDF file to use as local
                (eg myrdf.rdf. defaults to local.rdf)

           -u uri to treat that file as
                (eg http://redfoot.sourceforge.net/2000/10/.
                 defaults to http://hostname.domain:port/path)

           -p port number to run on
                (defaults to 8000)

           -P path from server root to actual RDF
                (eg /2000/10. defaults to /)

    See sample/sample.{sh,bat} for an example of invoking with a custom UI 
    for viewing.
