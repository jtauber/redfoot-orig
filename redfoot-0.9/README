REDFOOT README

Redfoot is a framework for distributed RDF-based applications, written in Python
by James Tauber and Daniel Krech.

At present, Redfoot includes:

    - an RDF database
    - a query API for RDF with numerous higher-level query functions
    - an RDF parser and serializer
    - a simple HTTP server providing a web interface for viewing and
      editing RDF
    - the beginnings of a peer-to-peer architecture for communication
      between different RDF databases

In the future, Redfoot will hopefully include:

    - a full peer-to-peer architecture for discovery of RDF statements
    - an inference engine
    - a fully customizable UI
    - connectors for mapping non-RDF data into RDF triples
    - sample applications built on top of Redfoot

Redfoot is written in pure Python and is being tested on Python 1.6 and
2.0b1 (soon 2.0b2)

RUNNING THE REDFOOT SERVER

Make sure the parent directory of redfoot is on the python path. The easiest way
to do that is to set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to include ../

Run

	python server.py <port> <rdf-file> <rdf-URI>

	where all arguments are optional.
