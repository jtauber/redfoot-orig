REDFOOT DEVELOPER MANUAL

Redfoot is a framework for distributed RDF-based applications. The
purpose of this document is to outline the current design and future
plans for the benefit of those wishing to assist in the development of
Redfoot.

At present, Redfoot includes:

    - an RDF database
    - a query API for RDF with numerous higher-level query functions
    - an RDF parser and serializer
    - a simple HTTP server providing a web interface for viewing and
      editing RDF
    - a fully customizable UI
    - the beginnings of a peer-to-peer architecture for communication
      between different RDF databases

In the future, Redfoot will hopefully include:

    - a full peer-to-peer architecture for discovery of RDF statements
    - an inference engine
    - connectors for mapping non-RDF data into RDF triples
    - sample applications built on top of Redfoot

Redfoot is written in pure Python and requires Python 2.0 + PyExpat.

The RDF-handling parts of Redfoot are to be found in lib/rdf. See
lib/rdf/RDFLIB_MANUAL.txt for details.

This document assumes familarity with the RDF library in lib/rdf.
