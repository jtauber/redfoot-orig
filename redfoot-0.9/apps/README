REDFOOT APPS README

    There are a growing number of sample Redfoot applications in this
    directory:

	* generic viewer / editor
	* sample1 - simple app written in Python
	* sample2 - simple todo app written in RedCode
	* sample3 - RedCode app combining modules for authentication,
                    rss/weblogs and neighbour connections

WHAT IS REDCODE?

    RedCode is a combination of Python and XML that makes it easier to
    combine Python code with XHTML. Anything in RedCode could be
    written as straight Python but RedCode makes things a little
    easier when writing Redfoot applications. See sample2.xml or
    sample3.xml for examples.

    run.bat or run.sh can be used to run RedCode.
