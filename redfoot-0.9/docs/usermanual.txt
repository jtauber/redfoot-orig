REDFOOT USER MANUAL

    Redfoot is a framework for building web applications and sites
    that are driven by RDF and are possibly peer-to-peer.

REQUIREMENTS

    You must be running Python 2.0 including pyexpat.

INTRODUCTION

    Typically, an application or site will consist of:
        - Redfoot itself
        - Custom UI (written in Python)
        - RDF data

    If all you are interested in doing is viewing and editing RDF, you
    don't need any custom UI. Redfoot includes a generic,
    browser-based viewer and editor.

STARTING REDFOOT WITH GENERIC UI

    Go to the apps directory and run generic.sh or generic.bat and
    Redfoot will start up. By default, Redfoot will be running on port
    8000 and will be using local.rdf as the RDF data.

    If you open a browser and go to
        http://localhost:8000/
    the RDF will be displayed in its raw XML serialization.

    To access the viewer/editor, try going to
        http://www.localhost:8000/classList

    Often, it is not desirable for Redfoot to run at the root of the
    server's URI space. The -P option allows you to specify the path
    on which Redfoot should operate. For example
        redfoot.sh -P /2000/11/redfoot
    would mean that the RDF is available at
        http://localhost:8000/2000/11/redfoot
    and the viewer/editor at
        http://localhost:8000/2000/11/redfoot/classList

STARTING REDFOOT WITH A CUSTOM UI

    Typically, a custom UI will be provided as a python class which is
    a subclass of BaseUI. A special file will be run to start up
    Redfoot with that particular UI. See apps/sample1.sh for an
    example.

    Note that in almost all cases, a Redfoot with a custom UI will
    have the -P path specified. The generic Redfoot UI will then be
    available at that path with the rest of server's URI space
    available for the custom UI.

    Often, the generic UI will be retained for editing the RDF,
    although the custom UI may provide custom editing as well as
    custom views.

STARTUP COMMANDLINE OPTIONS

    The following options may be passed to the Redfoot server on the
    commandline at startup:

        -l location of RDF file to use as local
           (eg myrdf.rdf. defaults to local.rdf)

        -u uri to treat that file as
           (eg http://redfoot.sourceforge.net/2000/10/.
            defaults to http://hostname.domain:port/path)

        -p port number to run on
           (defaults to 8000)

        -P path from server root to actual RDF
           (eg /2000/10/redfoot. defaults to /)

USING GENERIC UI: VIEWS

    There are five different views of the RDF provided by the generic
    Redfoot UI:

        - Resources by Class
        - Full Subclass Tree
        - Partial Subclass Tree
        - RDF
        - Triples

    All are available under VIEW in the black menu bar.

    Resources by Class     - lists the resources categorized by their
                             type(s)

    Full Subclass Tree     - shows the hierarchy of classes along with the
                             resources in each class

    Partial Subclass Tree  - similar to above, but only shows one
                             level at a time will the ability to drill
                             down and back up

    RDF                    - the raw RDF serialized as XML

    Triples                - the RDF in triple form displayed in a
                             table

USING GENERIC UI: VIEWING RESOURCE PROPERTIES

    If you click on a resource, you will see a view of the properties
    of that resource that are known by the Redfoot.

    The left column indicates the property and the right column the
    value. Clicking on a property will take you to the property
    definition. If the value of a property is a resource, clicking on
    a value will take you to the view of that resource.

    Reified statements about the given resource are displayed in white
    with a red border and additionally include a link to the reified
    statement.

USING GENERIC UI: EDITING RESOURCE PROPERTIES

    You can switch between editing and viewing by clicking one of
    view | edit

    [TODO: Need to have explained concept of neighbourhood to explain
     why some property values can't be changed]

    Properties whose values are known but not stated locally cannot be
    changed and they appear just like when viewing the resource
    properties.

    However, if a property's value is stated locally, its value may be
    changed. There will be a column between the property's name and
    its value that gives the property's range. If the range of the
    property is Literal, an input box will be provided. If the range
    of the property is a particular class, then a drop down will be
    provided that lists the known instances of that class (including
    subclasses).

    Note that once a new value has been entered or selected, the
    change won't be made until you press the update button.

    Properties may also be deleted and reified.

    At the bottom left of the table is a drop down where you can
    select a new property to add. This list is of those properties
    known to have a domain of the resource you are currently looking
    at. Note that, in the current version of Redfoot, you will need to
    click the update button in order to be able to specify a value for
    the new property.

    Finally, you may delete all local properties stated of a resource.

USING GENERIC UI: ADDING A RESOURCE

    To make a statement about a resource not currently known, or to
    create a new resource, click on Add a Resource in the EDIT menu.

    By default, Redfoot will assume that the resource is internal to
    the Redfoot (ie the URI for the resource is just the URI of the
    Redfoot as a whole + # + a local ID). The local ID will be
    autogenerated based on the time.

    You can change this to an external resource, or to a more
    appropriate local ID (but it must be unique).

    At this stage, you must also specify a label and a type for the
    resource.
