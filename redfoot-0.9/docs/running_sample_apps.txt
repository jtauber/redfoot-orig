REDFOOT APPS README

    There are a growing number of sample Redfoot applications in the
    apps directory:

	* generic viewer / editor
	* sample1 - simple app written in Python
	* sample2 - simple todo app written in RedCode
	* sample3 - RedCode app combining neighbour connection module
	            and experimental RSS module

WHAT IS REDCODE?

    RedCode is a combination of Python and XML that makes it easier to
    combine Python code with XHTML. Anything in RedCode could be
    written as straight Python but RedCode makes things a little
    easier when writing Redfoot applications. See apps/sample2.xml or
    apps/sample3.xml for examples.

    apps/run.bat or apps/run.sh can be used to run RedCode.

GENERIC VIEWER / EDITOR

    To start, go to the apps directory and run one of
	* generic.bat (Windows)
	* generic.sh (Unix)
	* python generic.py (if Redfoot library is on PYTHONPATH)

    To learn more about the Generic UI and how to use it, see
        docs/usermanual.txt 

SAMPLE1

    To start, go to the apps directory and run one of
	* run.bat sample1 (Windows)
	* run.sh sample1 (Unix)
	* python sample1.py (if Redfoot library is on PYTHONPATH)

    Then go to your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000/
    At the moment Redfoot doesn't know anyone, so go to the editor.
    You will see that the class "Person" is defined. We want to create
    a new resource that is of type "Person", so click on "Create an
    Abstract Resource".
    Select "type" as a new property to add and click on update.
    Now select a value of "Person" for this property and click on
    update.
    Select "label" as a new property to add and click on update.
    Now type a value for the label such as "John Smith" and press
    update.
    You've now added a new Person. Click on HOME at the top to go to
    the main page. You should see John Smith listed as a known
    person.

SAMPLE2

    To start, go to the apps directory and run one of
	* run.bat sample2 (Windows)
	* run.sh sample2 (Unix)

    Then go to your web browser and go to http://localhost/
    This is a very simple task list.
    To add a task enter it in the text input and press enter.
    To delete a task when done, click on done.
    Clicking on a task's label will take you to the generic viewer for
    that task.
    Clicking on "Go to editor" will take you to the generic class
    list.
    NOTE: you can create as many properties as you like for Tasks and
    use the generic editor to add them to a task.

SAMPLE3

    To start, go to the apps directory and run one of
	* run.bat sample3 (Windows)
	* run.sh sample3 (Unix)

    Then go to your web browser and go to http://localhost/
    This application displays RSS 1.0 items. It also demonstrates the
    ability to connect and disconnect to RDF sources.
    NOTE: The two modules used to build this app are orthogonal: the
    RSS items can be local and the neighbour page can be used to
    connect to any RDF source whether RSS or not.
    To begin, click on Neighbours.
    You'll see a list of the current neighbourhood as well as a list
    of other known RDF sources.
    To add a new RDF source to the neighbourhood, enter its URI in the
    text input box and click Add.
    To connect to a known RDF source, press the Connect button next to
    its URI.
    If you are connected to an RSS feed, you can now go back to the
    home page and see the RSS displayed.
