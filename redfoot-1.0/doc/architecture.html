    <H1>Redfoot Architectural Overview</H1>
    <P><B>Redfoot</B> is a framework for building distributed data-driven applications (generally web sites). Redfoot
       uses RDF as the underlying model for all data because of the extensibility and the ability
       to express relationships between any objects.</P>

    <P>This document is designed to provide an architectural overview of Redfoot. It (currently) assumes a knowledge of Python and RDF.</P>

    <H2>Top-level</H2>

    <P>Three key pieces make up the Redfoot distribution:</P>

    <DL>
      <DT>core</DT>
      <DD>the foundation for creating and running the components. This includes RDF parsing and serialization, the triple store, query functions, web server, etc</DD>
      <DT>components</DT>
      <DD>the building-blocks that make up applications built with Redfoot. These include modules, connectors and redcode tag libraries</DD>
      <DT>apps</DT>
      <DD>the glue that combines modules to make applications</DD>
    </DL>     

    <H2>Core</H2>

    <H3>Triple Store</H3>

    <P>Redfoot stores RDF triples in a class called TripleStore (see core/redfoot/rdf/store/triple.py).
       There are three important methods on TripleStore:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI><CODE>add(<VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR>, <VAR>object</VAR>)</CODE></LI>
      <LI><CODE>remove(<VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR>, <VAR>object</VAR>)</CODE></LI>
      <LI><CODE>visit(<VAR>callback</VAR>, (<VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR>, <VAR>object</VAR>))</CODE></LI>
    </UL>
    
    <P>In both <CODE>remove</CODE> and <CODE>visit</CODE>, any of <VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR> and
       <VAR>object</VAR> can be <CODE>None</CODE> which indicates that any value will match.

    <P><CODE>visit</CODE> causes <VAR>callback</VAR> to be called for each matching triple. <VAR>callback</VAR>
       must have the signature <CODE>callback(<VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR>, <VAR>object</VAR>)</CODE>
       but see below on functors.</P>

    <P>What types of Python object are used for each item of a triple? Technically, the triple store doesn't
       care but in Redfoot, each item in a triple is either a <CODE>Resource</CODE> or <CODE>Literal</CODE>
       object (see core/redfoot/rdf/objects.py).
       These classes aren't instantiated directly because then different
       instantiations of a Resource with the same URI would result in different instances representing the
       same thing. So instead, these objects are created via the <CODE>resource(<VAR>uri</VAR>)</CODE> and
       <CODE>literal(<VAR>value</VAR>)</CODE> which return the correct instance.</P>

    <P>There are some handy constants for syntax and schema resource URIs defined in
       core/redfoot/rdf/consts.py</P>

    <H4>Code Example</H4>
    
    <PRE CLASS="code_sample">
from redfoot.rdf.store.triple import TripleStore
from redfoot.rdf.objects import resource, literal
from redfoot.rdf.consts import *

store = TripleStore()
store.add(resource("http://www.jtauber.com/"), LABEL, literal("James Tauber's Website"))

def print_triple(s, p, o):
    print s, p, o

store.visit(print_triple, (resource("http://www.jtauber.com/"), None, None))</PRE>

    <P>If the triple store is to be loaded from and saved to an XML serialization, <CODE>TripleStore</CODE>
       is mixed in with the <CODE>StoreIO</CODE> class and a parser and serializer.
       See core/redfoot/rdf/store/storeio.py for an example of this where the mix-in <CODE>TripleStoreIO</CODE>
       is defined. Similarly, core/redfoot/rdf/store/autosave.py extends TripleStoreIO to autosave the RDF.</P>

    <H3>Rednodes</H3>

    <P>At the very core of a Redfoot application is the concept of a rednode. A rednode combines multiple
       triple stores (TripleStoreIO instances) and mixes in additional query functionality.
       Rednodes are implemented as the class <CODE>RedNode</CODE> in core/redfoot/rednode.py</P>

    <P>A rednode has a local triple store (which is read/write) and any number of neighbour triple stores
       (which are read only). The combination of the local store and neighbour stores is referred to as the
       neighbourhood. The process of adding a new neighbour is referred to as connecting to that neighbour.</P>

    <P>When a rednode is created, the RDF syntax and schema files are added to the neighbourhood automatically
       as well as a schema for some builtin classes and properties used by Redfoot.</P>

    <H4>Code Example</H4>
    
    <PRE CLASS="code_sample">
rednode = RedNode()
rednode.local.load(<VAR>location</VAR>, <VAR>URI_if_different</VAR>)
rednode.connect_to(<VAR>location</VAR>)

# query the local store
rednode.local.visit(<VAR>callback</VAR>, (<VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR>, <VAR>object</VAR>))

# query only the neighbours
rednode.neighbours.visit(<VAR>callback</VAR>, (<VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR>, <VAR>object</VAR>))

# query the whole neighbourhood (local + neighbours)
rednode.neighbourhood.visit(<VAR>callback</VAR>, (<VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR>, <VAR>object</VAR>))
# or just
rednode.visit(<VAR>callback</VAR>, (<VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR>, <VAR>object</VAR>))</PRE>

    <H3>Queries</H3>

    <P>We saw above that the most general type of query on a triple store is performed via the <CODE>visit</CODE>
       method of the form: <CODE>visit(<VAR>callback</VAR>, (<VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR>, <VAR>object</VAR>))</CODE></P>

    <P><CODE>visit</CODE> causes <VAR>callback</VAR> to be called for each matching triple. <VAR>callback</VAR>
       must have the signature <CODE>callback(<VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR>, <VAR>object</VAR>)</CODE>.</P>

    <P>There are two techniques available to build up more complex queries: functors and builders. Functors
       enable the developer to change the way the callback is called. Builders enable results to be built up
       for purposes like sorting and removal of duplicates.</P>

    <P>There are also some predefined queries available.

    <P>see <A HREF="queries.html">separate document introducing queries</A>.</P>
