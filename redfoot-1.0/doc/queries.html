    <H1>Writing Redfoot Queries</H1>

    <P>We saw above that the most general type of query on a triple store is performed via the
       <CODE>visit</CODE> method of the form: <CODE>visit(<VAR>callback</VAR>, (<VAR>subject</VAR>,
       <VAR>predicate</VAR>, <VAR>object</VAR>))</CODE></P>

    <P><CODE>visit</CODE> causes <VAR>callback</VAR> to be called for each matching triple.
       <VAR>callback</VAR> must have the signature <CODE>callback(<VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR>,
       <VAR>object</VAR>)</CODE>.</P>

    <P>There are two techniques available to build up more complex queries: functors and builders. Functors
       enable the developer to change the way the callback is called. Builders enable results to be built up
       for purposes like sorting and removal of duplicates.</P>

    <H2>Functors</H2>

    <P>A functor is just a function that returns a function. Let's look at a simple example in the context of
       Redfoot queries. Imagine we have the following query and function:</P>

    <PRE CLASS="code_sample">
rednode.visit(<VAR>callback</VAR>, (JTAUBER, KNOWS, None))

def list_friend(friend):
    print friend</PRE>

    <P>We can't use <CODE>list_friend</CODE> as the callback because the first argument has to take a
       function with the signature <CODE>callback(<VAR>subject</VAR>, <VAR>predicate</VAR>,
       <VAR>object</VAR>)</CODE> and <CODE>list_friend</CODE> only takes a single argument.</P>

    <P>What we need is a function that takes three arguments (so it can be used as the callback) but then
       calls <CODE>list_friend</CODE> with just one of those three. We could write the function like
       this:</P> 

    <PRE CLASS="code_sample">
rednode.visit(my_callback, (JTAUBER, KNOWS, None))

def my_callback(subject, predicate, object):
    list_friend(object)

def list_friend(friend):
    print friend</PRE>

    <P>but there is an easier way with functors that saves us having to write another function.</P>
    <P>In core/redfoot/rdf/query/functors.py there is a functor <CODE>o()</CODE> that takes a function of
       only one argument and makes it into one that takes three. The "o" is short for "object" because
       the original function will be called using the third argument (the object) passed to the newly created
       function.</P>

    <P>So using the o() functor, the previous example could be written:</P>

    <PRE CLASS="code_sample">
from redfoot.rdf.query.functors import o

rednode.visit(o(list_friend), (JTAUBER, KNOWS, None))

def list_friend(friend):
    print friend</PRE>

    <P>Another functor so(), takes a two-argument function and makes it into a function that can be used as
       a visit call back. The "so" is short for "subject-object" because the original function will be called
       using the first and third (subject and object) arguments passed to the newly created function.</P>

    <PRE CLASS="code_sample">
from redfoot.rdf.query.functors import so

rednode.visit(so(list_friend_pair), (None, KNOWS, None))

def list_friend_pair(friend1, friend2):
    print friend1, "knows", friend2</PRE>

    <P>There is also a <CODE>po()</CODE> functor, for when you want to call a function with the predicate
       and object pairs that match the triple.</P>

    <P><CODE>both(<VAR>callback1</VAR>, <VAR>callback2</VAR>)</CODE> will create a function that calls both
       the given callbacks.

    <P><CODE>first(<VAR>callback</VAR>)</CODE> will create a function that calls the given callback only for
       the first triple that matches.</P>
