	Neighbour connect now reports error message feedback to the right
	of the connect remove buttons.

	Now has a -h,--hostname command line option for setting the
	hostname of the server. Default is now the fully qualified
	hostname.

	There is now a --exact option that, when specified, tells the
	server to listen only to those requests coming in to host via the
	exact hostname. (By default, the server listens to all request
	coming in to host via any hostname.)

	Renamed StatementBuilder to ItemBuilder and made accept take a
	single argument (use functors if you want to make it take three).

	Combined the functionality of functor subject() into s().

	Removed not_subject() and instead made a negative of exists().

	Fixed expat import problem with Python 2.0.

	Fixed HTML bug where some forms were being submitted twice by
	Netscape.

	Fixed permission denied problem on directories that were trying to
	be autoloaded.
