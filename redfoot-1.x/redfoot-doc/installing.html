    <h1>Installing Redfoot</h1>

    <h2>Prerequisite</h2> 
      <p><a href="http://python.org/2.2/">Python version 2.2.x</a> is required
and needs to be installed first.</p>

    <h2>Running Install</h2>
    <p>From the root directory run the following command:</p>
    <pre class="code_sample">python install.py</pre>
    <p>Since this is a development version, the redfootlib package is
<em>not</em> installed in Python's site-packages directory. However, the above
command should install the required version of the
Medusa package if you do not yet have a version installed. If you
already have a version of Medusa installed, you will likely have to
manually update it to the version included in this release (0.5.2-rf1)
which, at the time of this release, is the latest <a
href="http://www.amk.ca/python/code/medusa.html">Updated Medusa
Release</a> plus one bug fix required by Redfoot. The bug fix has been
made to the Medusa CVS and so should be in 0.5.3 when it comes out.</p>
