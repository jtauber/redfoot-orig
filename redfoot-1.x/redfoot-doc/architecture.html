    <H1>Redfoot Architectural Overview</H1>

<p>

<B>Redfoot</B> is an extensible RDF server for building {peer|distributed}
networks of data sharing nodes upon which applications may be built.

</p>
<p>

At the highest level Redfoot consists of two pieces, namely, an {RDF
Container|RDF Application Server} for running the nodes that form the
network and a library from which nodes may be extended with
specialized application specific functionality. The Container is simply
called Redfoot and the library redfootlib.

</p>

<p>
    Redfoot uses RDF as the underlying model for all data because of the extensibility and the ability to express relationships between any objects.
</p>

    <P>This document is designed to provide an architectural overview of Redfoot. It (currently) assumes a knowledge of <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>.</P>

    <H2>Top-level</H2>

    <p>Three key pieces make up Redfoot </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Redfoot Container</dt>
      <dd>A container for running RedNodes, namely, redfoot.py</dd>
      <dt>Redfoot Library</dt>
      <dd>A library for extending Redfoot with new node types, HTTP
interfaces, connectors, store mixins, triple store implementations,
etc. Also, it is the library from with the Redfoot Container is build
and includes RDF parsing and serialization, an in memory triple store,
query functions, web server, etc. The redfoot library is contained
within a top level python package called redfootlib.
      </dd>
      <dt>Redfoot Component Library</dt>
      <dd>Some standard extensions to the Redfoot Library for building
RedNodes. These include modules, connectors and redcode tag libraries,
etc. Currently, the Redfoot Component Library is composed of two
top level python packages called redmodules and redconnectors.

    <p>At the very core of Redfoot is the notion of a <a href="tripleStore.html">TripleStore</a>
