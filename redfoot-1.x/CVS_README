
The medusa sdist is expected to be a subdirectory of this one. At the moment, the version from project oedipus' CVS is required since it contains a needed bug fix to medusa-0.5.2. See:
  http://oedipus.sourceforge.net/

  - update CHANGELOG 
  - tag the release 
    - cvs tag RELEASE_XX_XX_XX 
  - up CVS major revision (so 2.0 = first release, 3.0 = second release, etc) 
    - cvs commit -m "NEW RELEASE" -r y.0 
    - cvs update -A 
  - export to a new directory 
    - cvs -d eikeon@cvs.redfoot.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/redfoot export -r RELEASE_01_XX_XX -d redfoot-X.X.X redfoot-1.x

  - 

  - tar 
    - tar -cvz --exclude=CVS_README --exclude=.cvsignore -f redfoot-1.5.0.tgz redfoot-1.5.0 

  - release on sourceforge (or whereever hosted) 
  - send freshmeat announcement 
  - announce elsewhere (relevant mailing lists, news groups, etc)
