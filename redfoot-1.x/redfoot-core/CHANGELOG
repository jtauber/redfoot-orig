	RELEASE 1.5.0

	Processors are now involked on all sub modules with a matching
	processor.

	App now calls save on ParentModule which calls save on all sub
	modules that have save

	RedDaemon now calls stop on the app when it is stopped. It used to
	call save on the app's rednode, but an app may want to do other
	things as well.

	RELEASE 1.0.0

	Fixed minor bug that was causing non redcode sub-modules (such as
	Static) not to work.


2001/09/04
	RELEASE 0.9.99-pre3

	An app's (or a parent module's) sub modules are now accessible
	from within __init__.

	Fixed Unicode errors by removing the use of Unicode objects and
	switching to UTF-8 strings.
	
	Connecting to a local neighbour file no longer creates file if it
	doesn't exist.

	RELEASE 0.9.99-pre2

	Redcode includes a new tag "visit" which allows for callback
	facets to be inlined.

	Introduced a functor that creates a sorted visit function from any
	visit function and a comparator.

	Rednode now saves local RDF on shutdown.

	Neighbours with CONNECTED property of YES now connected to
	automatically on startup.

	Modules can now specify the RDF they would like loaded on
	startup.

	Version number display on startup.

	self.app is now available in module __init__s.

	Python 2.x is explicitly checked for on startup.

	Improved messages when syntax errors occur.

	Neighbour connection now considerably faster.

	Reconnecting neighbours now works.

	App with only an empty string facet no longer causes an infinite
	loop.

	Lack of response no longer causes an infinite loop.

	Removed unused code in rednode


2001/08/21
	RELEASE 0.9.99-pre1	

	Now has a -h,--hostname command line option for setting the
	hostname of the server. Default is now the fully qualified
	hostname.

	There is now a --exact option that, when specified, tells the
	server to listen only to those requests coming in to host via the
	exact hostname. (By default, the server listens to all request
	coming in to host via any hostname.)

	Renamed StatementBuilder to ItemBuilder and made accept take a
	single argument (use functors if you want to make it take three).

	Combined the functionality of functor subject() into s().

	Removed not_subject() and instead made a negative of exists().

	Fixed expat import problem with Python 2.0.

	Fixed HTML bug where some forms were being submitted twice by
	Netscape.

	Fixed permission denied problem on directories that were trying to
	be autoloaded.

	Specific exceptions are now thrown if sub-module element is
	missing required attributes or contains content.
