	RELEASE 0.9.1

	There is now a remove and a remove_triples (no more overloaded
	remove).

	Layer 2 has been merged with layer 1 since there is no longer a
	need for them to be separate layers.

	The generate_uri method has moved to LoadSave since triple stores
	do not have a notion of a uri. [Also, with proper bNode support on
	its way the need for a generate_uri might not be as high.]

	Fixed bug in node's n3 function: URI -> URIRef.

	Replaced string based exceptions with class based exceptions.

	RELEASE 0.9.0

	Initial release after being split from redfootlib.
