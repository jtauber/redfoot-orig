redfoot-orig
============

With this exception of this file, this repo is the original SourceForge-hosted,
CVS version of Redfoot developed by James Tauber and Daniel Krech (eikeon).

It started as an RDF library (later broken out as `rdflib`) and a Web-based RDF
editor but then the authors started exploring peer-to-peer sharing of triples
and a richer application development framework.

Note that the top-level directories are actually CVS modules so are almost best
viewed as separate projects.

Note also that eikeon did further work on Redfoot a number of years later which
is available at <https://github.com/eikeon/redfoot>.
