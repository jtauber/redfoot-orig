redfoot-orig
============

With this exception of this file, this repo is the original SourceForge-hosted,
CVS version of Redfoot developed by James Tauber and Daniel Krech.

It started as an RDF library (later broken out as `rdflib`) and a Web-based RDF
editor but then the authors started exploring peer-to-peer sharing of triples
and a richer application development framework.
